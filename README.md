# definitions-app

## An applicaiton for easy definition look up while studying

Currently in the early stages of the project. In order to run the application the server and client sides of the application must be started seperately.
The server side contains a seeds file which when run will seed MongoDB so long as Mongo is running on the default port.

### Todo:

-Write functionality to edit definitions
-Error handling on the client side for api calls
-Implement Edit/Delete functionality for courses
-UI styling
